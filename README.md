# Moon Rocks
Moon Rocks is a fictional company that sells samples of other planets, and this is their website. I created this website for my final project for Web Development HTML & CSS class.

Some highlights:
- Pages are static HTML and CSS
- Uses CSS flexbox and grid
- Mobile-first CSS styles are gradually overridden as screen size increases
- JPEG images were optimized using GIMP
- There is a small amount of Javascript to make the menu for small screens work
- SVG images were written as text
- Uses a font from the Google Fonts API
